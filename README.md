# rust-L0-thebook

This repository documents my journey learning Rust through  
**The Rust Programming Language** (commonly known as *The Book*).

## Structure

Each chapter I go through has its own directory, containing:
- Mini-projects
- Exercises and examples
- Experiments to reinforce key concepts
